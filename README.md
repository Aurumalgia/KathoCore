=================
You can compile the plugin from scratch using [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [Maven](http://maven.apache.org). if you have them now you can just put that command in your command line:
```
$ mvn package
```
But if you want use it as dependencie of another project you can use:
